Gnvim's cursors respects neovim's blink options through 'guicursor'. In
addition to blink wait, on and off, gnvim has cursor transition state which
defines the time it takes to transition from one state to another. This can
be set through `set_cursor_blink_transition`: >

    require('gnvim').set_cursor_blink_transition(100)
<
The blink transition is in milliseconds.

Additionally, the cursors position change is also animated. The speed of this
can be set through `set_cursor_position_transition`.
